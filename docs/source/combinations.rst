Combinations
============

One of the steps that lead to this project, as detailed in :doc:`development`, is the search for a reference document,
showing how characters on a typewriter can be combined, to produce characters that are otherwise missing.

It would be amiss for me to document this project, without creating, and aiming to maintain such a list.

In the following, I will list a name, show the relevant unicode character, show the typed combination,
and the components that constitute it.

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Name", "Character", "Construction"
    :widths: 10, 5, 20

    "Exclamation mark", "!", .. figure:: ../../../Doc_Images/Exclamation.png
    "Circled plus", "ðŸœ¨", .. figure:: ../../../Doc_Images/Exclamation.png
    "Interrobang", "â€½", .. figure:: ../../../Doc_Images/Exclamation.png
